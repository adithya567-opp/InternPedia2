1. **Importing modules**:
   - `tkinter` is imported to create the GUI application.
   - `from collections import Counter` imports the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which is used to count the occurrences of words in the text.

2. **Function `countWords(s)`**:
   - This function takes a string `s` as input.
   - It defines a list of punctuation characters (`signos`).
   - It creates an empty string `cleanstr`.
   - It iterates over each character in the input string `s` (converted to lowercase).
   - If the character is a punctuation character, it is skipped (not added to `cleanstr`).
   - If the character is not a punctuation character, it is added to `cleanstr`.
   - After the loop, `cleanstr` contains the input string without any punctuation characters.
   - The function splits `cleanstr` into a list of words (`strlist`) using the space character as the delimiter.
   - Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique words, and the values are the counts of each word.

3. **Function `button_count()`**:
   - This function is triggered when the "Count words" button is clicked.
   - It retrieves the text entered by the user from the entry field (`mainWindow.e2.get()`).
   - It calls the `countWords` function with the user's text and stores the result in the `count` variable.
   - It creates a new `Label` widget with the text displaying the word counts (`myLabel = Label(root, text=count)`).
   - It displays the `Label` widget on the GUI using the `pack()` method.

4. **Creating the main window**:
   - The code creates an instance of the `Tk` class, which represents the main window of the GUI application.
   - It sets the title of the window to "Count words".
   - It sets the initial size of the window to 400x400 pixels.

5. **Class `Window`**:
   - This class is responsible for creating the GUI components.
   - In the `__init__` method:
     - It stores the root window (`self.root = root`).
     - It creates a `StringVar` object (`self.e2`) to hold the text entered by the user.
     - It creates an `Entry` widget (`self.e`) where the user can enter text, using the `self.e2` variable to store the entered text.
     - It creates a "Count words" button (`self.button`) that calls the `button_count` function when clicked.
     - It creates an "Exit" button (`self.exit_button`) that closes the application when clicked.
     - All the widgets are packed (displayed) on the GUI using the `pack()` method.

6. **Main execution**:
   - The code checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module) using the `if __name__ == '__main__':` condition.
   - If the condition is true, it creates an instance of the `Window` class (`mainWindow = Window(root)`), passing the root window as an argument.
   - Finally, it enters the Tkinter event loop using `root.mainloop()`, which keeps the GUI application running and responsive to user events.
